==============
This code analyzes proteins of interest for conservation and for Eukaryotic linear motifs. 

Structure; 

Pick Protein of Interest and multiple species of interest, find uniprot number  


Use ELM api to gather data for proteins/species of interest. 

Compare ELMs between proteins	
     Find common ELM types
	 Line up ELMs using MSA

Display 
	Summary data in table

	
Later: 	
annotated SC and KL sequences in Jalview and open up the associated tree - allow display of ELM notes? 
Use data from the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project to generate a conservation map of each protein in SC.
